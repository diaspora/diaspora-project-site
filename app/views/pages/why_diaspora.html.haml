      %p.lead
        Diaspora* is a new concept in social networking, based on three key philosophies: open source, distributed networks, and privacy.

        What this means for you and the world?

          Not just another social network.

          Open Source
        %p
          The code which makes Diaspora* work is available to any developer around the world to improve upon. Diaspora* is continually being developed by a community rather than a corporation. Contributions and improvements are vetted and rolled-out only after careful bug checks. [‘more about this’ link]

          Distributed
        %p
          Instead of everyone’s data being contained on centralized servers owned by a corporation, local servers (‘pods’) can be set up anywhere in the world. You can choose which pod to register with, perhaps your local pod, and seamlessly connect with the D* community worldwide. [‘more about this’ link]

      .span-one-third
        %h4
          Privacy
        %p
          Unique to Diaspora* is that YOU own your data. You do not sign over any rights to a corporation or other interest who could use it for commercial purposes. With Diaspora*, your friends,  your habits, and your content is your business...not ours! [‘more about this’ link]
