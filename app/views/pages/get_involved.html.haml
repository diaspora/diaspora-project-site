          What does it all mean?
        %p
          Open source is about individuality, transparency, creativity, and destiny. It is about having an idea, and making it reality. Diaspora* was founded to fulfill a passion for fun, and for making the Internet a better place. Open source is what enables us to change the world, for ourselves, and let our friends across the web benefit from our exploration.

        %p
          Open source communities are amazing things. At Diaspora*, we believe that people should be valued for what they do. It does not matter if you have contributed to a project before, or are an elite open source hacker. Contributing to Diaspora* means that you get to work on hard problems, with a focus on solutions that work for users. This is why if you contribute something meaningful to Diaspora*, we will give you core commit access. We are in this together, so giving excited people the chance to make huge changes always trumps keeping control sacred.
