          What does it all mean?
        %p
          Open source is about individuality, transparency, creativity, and destiny. It is about having an idea, and making it reality. Diaspora* was founded to fulfill a passion for fun, and for making the Internet a better place. Open source is what enables us to change the world, for ourselves, and let our friends across the web benefit from our exploration.

        %p
          Open source communities are amazing things. At Diaspora*, we believe that people should be valued for what they do. It does not matter if you have contributed to a project before, or are an elite open source hacker. Contributing to Diaspora* means that you get to work on hard problems, with a focus on solutions that work for users. This is why if you contribute something meaningful to Diaspora, we will give you core commit access. We are in this together, so giving excited people the chance to make huge changes always trumps keeping control sacred.
