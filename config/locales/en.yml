      headline: "Welcome to diaspora*"
      byline: "The online social world where you are in control"
      register: "Sign up »"
      key_philosophies: "diaspora* is based on three key philosophies:"
      decentralization: Decentralization
      decentralization_about: "Instead of everyone’s data being contained on huge central servers owned by a large organization, local servers (“pods”) can be set up anywhere in the world. You choose which pod to register with - perhaps your local pod - and seamlessly connect with the diaspora* community worldwide."
      freedom: Freedom
      freedom_about: "You can be whoever you want to be in diaspora*. Unlike some networks, you don’t have to use your real identity. You can interact with whomever you choose in whatever way you want. The only limit is your imagination. diaspora* is also Free Software, giving you liberty to use it as you wish."
      privacy: Privacy
      privacy_about: "In diaspora* you own your data. You do not sign over any rights to a corporation or other interest who could use it. With diaspora*, your friends, your habits, and your content is your business ... not ours! In addition, you choose who sees what you share, using Aspects."
      get_started: "Want to get started?"
      get_started_sub: "It’s as easy as 1, 2, 3 ..."
      choose_pod: "1. Choose a pod"
      choose_pod_exp: "Find a pod that suits you. You might prefer a smaller pod, or one based near where you live, or one based in a country that you know has good data security policies. The choice is yours! Choose from among our community pods, perhaps one based in your locality."
      sign_up: "2. Sign up"
      sign_up_ex: "Once you’ve decided which pod is right for you, based on the ratings and information at %{poduptime} and maybe recommendations from people you trust, sign up there and create a profile with as much or as little personal information as you like. You are in control about how much you share."
      join_convo: "3. Join the conversation!"
      join_convo_ex: 'Start following some #tags related to your interests: it could be <span class="click">#music</span>, <span class="click">#photography</span>, <span class="click">#privacy</span> or <span class="click">#linux</span> - whatever you’re into. Share a public message with the <span class="click">#newhere</span> tag to introduce yourself, and away you go. You’re now part of the vibrant diaspora* community.'
      aspects: Aspects
      aspects_ex: "diaspora* pioneered the concept of aspects, which means you can organise your contacts according to their role in your life. This means you can share something just with family members or work colleagues, knowing that no one you don’t want to will be able to see what you post."
      features: Features
      features_ex: "Hashtags give you the freedom to label and follow your interests with ease. You can catch people’s attention by @mentioning them. Reshare posts you love so others can enjoy and comment on them too. And show your love for other people’s work by ♥ing it."
      help: "Want to help?"
      help_ex: "diaspora* needs people to write and test code, welcome and help new members, set up and maintain community pods, and spread the word about the benefits of diaspora* to others who might want to take part. Think you’d like to contribute to the project?"
      socialint: "Social network integration"
      socialint_ex: "Use diaspora* as your home base to post to your profiles on other major social services. This way your friends will still be able to keep in touch with what you’re up to, even if they’re not yet on diaspora*. diaspora* currently supports cross-posting to your Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr accounts, with more to come."

      headline: "How does diaspora* work?"
      byline: "diaspora* is simple to use – here’s how"
      menu_title: About
      decentralize: "What is decentralization?"
      decentralize_ex: "diaspora* is completely different from most networks that you use. It is completely decentralized, with no central “hub”. Even so, it’s very easy to connect and communicate with people. Here’s how."
      this: THIS
      this_ex: "diaspora* is a true network, with no central base. There are servers (called “pods”) all over the world, each containing the data of those users who have chosen to register with it. These pods communicate with each other seamlessly, so that you can register with any pod and communicate freely with your contacts, wherever they are on the network."
      notthis: "NOT THIS"
      notthis_ex: "Most social networks are run from centralized servers owned and run by a corporation. These store all the private data of their users. This information can be lost or hacked, and like any system with a bottleneck, any problem at the central servers can make the whole network run very slowly, or not at all. It is also more easy for governments to “listen in.”"
      discl: "(diaspora* uses open web standards such as %{pubsubhubub} and %{webfinger} to make this kind of connection possible.)"
      connect: "How do I connect?"
      connect_ex: "Even though diaspora* is made up of many pods all over the world, you will experience it as one integrated network. You don’t need to be on the same pod as your contacts in order to communicate freely with each other - communication happens seamlessly across all the pods in the diaspora* universe. When you’re using diaspora*, you can easily forget that it’s actually made up of many pods. Connecting with someone in diaspora* is actually really simple: "
      find: "1. Find them"
      find_ex: "All you need to do to connect to someone is find them and add them to an aspect. (See below for more on aspects.) Find them using the search field in the black bar, or hover over their name in your stream and a hovercard will appear. If you know their diaspora* ID (yourname@podname.com), you can use that."
      add: "2. Add them"
      add_ex: "Then it’s just a matter of clicking the “Add contact” button and choose which aspect you want them to be part of. You’re now connected and can share with them as you would on any other network. Or, if they’re part of different aspects of your life, add them to multiple aspects. You’re now connected. It’s as easy as that. "
      freedom: Freedom
      freedom_byline: "diaspora* doesn’t try to limit you"
      fdm1: "Be who you want to be"
      fdm1_ex: "A lot of networks insist that you use your real identity. Not diaspora*. Here you can choose who you want to be, and share as much or as little about yourself as you want. It really is up to you how you want to interact with other people."
      fdm2: "Be creative"
      fdm2_ex: "You’re not limited to how you can interact. You can just follow fascinating people to see what they have to say, or you can share world with everyone. Share your photos, artwork, videos, music, words - whatever you want. Let yourself fly."
      fdm3: "Free as in freedom"
      fdm3_ex: "diaspora* is completely Free Software. This means there are no limits on how it can be used. You can even take the source code and change it to make it work in the way you want to, and help us improve the network. We’d love to have you on board."
      privacy: Privacy
      privacy_byline: "Total control over what is yours "
      priv1: "Own your own data"
      priv1_ex: "Many networks use your data to make money by analysing your interactions and using this information to advertise things to you. diaspora* doesn’t use your data for any purpose other than allowing you to connect and share with others."
      priv2: "Host it yourself"
      priv2_ex: "Choose where your data are stored by choosing a pod you’re happy with. If you want to be really secure, you can set up and host your own pod on servers you control, so no one can get at your personal data."
      priv3: "Choose your audience"
      priv3_ex: "diaspora*’s aspects allow you to share with just those people you want to. You can be as public or as private as you like. Share a funny photo with the whole world, or a deep secret just with your closest friends. You’re in control."

      asp1: "Aspects of your life"
      asp1_ex: "Your life is made up of lots of different aspects, involving different people. Why should your online life be any different? With diaspora*’s aspects you can organize your online life as much as you want and share things only with the people you want to."
      asp2: "Organize your life"
      asp2_ex: "For example, you might have aspects for your family, for your closest friends, for work colleagues and for a sport or hobby you’re involved in. Your work colleagues don’t need to know about your family reunion, do they? With aspects, they won’t."
      asp3: "Tell the whole world"
      asp3_ex: "Of course, some things are so important that you want to tell the whole world about them. You can easily share something with the whole world by making it public. Using appropriate hashtags means it’ll reach people who are likely to enjoy it."

      host_ex: "diaspora* depends on its community members to host and run pods which are open to anyone who wants to take part. If you have some server space and a little bit of technical knowledge, we’d love it if you’d set up a pod which is open to registrations.

      welcome: 'Welcome to our “Getting started” guide. If you’ve found your way to this page, you’ve probably either just signed up to diaspora* or you’re thinking of doing so. In this series of tutorials we’ll walk you through the sign-up process and get you acquainted with the basics of how diaspora* works. We hope you find it useful, and that you enjoy using diaspora*!'
      find_pod: 'Finding a pod'
      find_pod_ex1: 'Unlike most social networking sites, which have a central hub of computers which store everyone’s data, we can’t give you one specific link and say: sign up here. diaspora* is different from those networks in that it is <em>decentralized</em>, with many different points of access. Before getting started, you’ll have to decide which diaspora* provider you want to sign up to. We call these providers “pods.”'
      find_pod_ex2: 'The word “diaspora” refers to the dispersal of seeds (or people) over a wide area. That’s why our motif is the dandelion, and the asterisk in our name represents a fluffy dandelion seed. We refer to individual accounts on diaspora* as “<strong>seeds</strong>,” and the servers in which those accounts are collected as “<strong>pods</strong>.” You’ll get used to it soon!'
      find_pod_ex3: 'To help you choose which pod is best for you, have a look at our %{wiki_link} to help you.'
      wiki_link_text: 'guide to choosing a pod'
      find_pod_ex4: 'You might have received an invitation to diaspora* from someone you know. If so, this contains a link to the diaspora* pod on which the person who invited you is registered. If you want to join to the same pod as them, you can simply follow the link in the mail. However, you don’t have to be on the same pod as your friend to communicate with them.'
      find_pod_ex5: 'You will always sign in to diaspora* on the same pod with which you registered. From your pod you can connect to the whole network and your experience of diaspora* should be more or less the same no matter which pod you are connecting from. You will not be able to sign in to another pod, but there is no need for you to do this anyway.'
      registration: 'Registration'
      registration1: 'Once you have chosen a pod, find the <span class="click">Sign up</span> link. It should be right there on the home page of the pod. If there is no “sign up” link, it might be that this particular pod is not currently accepting new registrations. In this case, you’ll need to choose another pod.'
      registration2: 'When you click the sign-up link you will be presented with a page on which you need to enter a user name, e-mail address and password. Think carefully when choosing your user name as you cannot change this at a later date.'
      registration3: 'Finish registration by clicking <span class="click">Continue</span> to create and access your brand new diaspora* seed!'
      registration4: 'During the registration process your seed will probably automatically be connected to one other seed. This will usually be our %{dhq_link} seed, but it may be your pod’s admin seed. This is so we can keep you up to date with important announcements about diaspora*. If, however, you prefer not to follow this seed, you can easily remove it from your contacts list. We’ll cover how to do this in %{part4_link}.'
      dhq_link_text: 'diaspora* HQ'
      registration5: 'You should now be presented with a “Getting Started” page. This is not obligatory, but completing it will be an enormous help in starting to making connections with other people.'

      registration7: 'Click the button to upload a profile photo from your computer.'
      registration8: 'If you want to connect your diaspora* seed to your Facebook account, clicking the link to do this can automate some of this process, such as pulling in your name and profile photo from your Facebook account.'
      registration9: 'Add a few words of things that interest you. It might be music, activism, perhaps the town you live in. These will be converted into #tags, which help you find content and help other people to discover you. We’ll explain more about #tags later in this tutorial.'
      registration10: 'Click <span class="click">Take me to diaspora*!</span>'
      profile1: 'Before you do anything else, take a minute to fill out your profile. On the screen you’re taken to, click your name or photo at the right-hand end of the black header bar, and select <span class="click">Profile</span> from the list which drops down. Then click the blue <span class="click">Edit my profile</span> button in the top right corner.'
      profile2: 'There are two parts to your profile: the public profile and the private profile. Your public profile is visible to everyone; your private profile is visible only to people you have chosen to share with. You can fill out as much or as little of your profile as you like, and you don’t have to use your real name if you don’t want to.'
      profile3: 'Most of the profile information fields are self-explanatory. NSFW stands for “not safe for work.” We’ll cover this in more detail in %{part7_link}, so don’t worry about it now.'

      interface2: 'Because of the decentralized and open-source nature of diaspora*, it is possible for pod administrators to customize their pods.

      column3: 'On the right are profile icons of the people whose posts appear in your stream as well as some links to help you invite your friends, welcome new users, find help, post to diaspora* from the rest of the web (the diaspora* “bookmarklet”) and on some pods, contact information for the pod’s administrator. (Note: on some pods the left- and right-hand columns are merged and placed either on the left or the right.)'

      stream1: 'posts made by your contacts;'
      stream2: 'public posts made containing #tags you follow;'
      stream3: 'posts that @mention you.'
      stream_ex2: 'Posts in the stream are ordered according to the time of the original post.'
      activity: 'My Activity'
      activity_ex: 'Your My Activity stream shows any posts which you have either liked or commented on. This is a useful way of catching up on any interactions you’ve been having in diaspora*. Posts in My Activity are ordered according to the latest activity (comment or like) on each post.'
      mentions: '@Mentions'
      mentions_ex: 'This lists any posts made by other people @mentioning you. We’ll discuss mentions in %{part4_link}.'
      aspects: 'My Aspects'
      aspects_ex1: 'My Aspects displays all posts made by all the people with whom you are sharing – that is, the people you have placed into your aspects. Don’t worry if you don’t know what an aspect is – we’re going to cover this in detail in the next part.'

      profile: 'Profile view'
      profile_ex1: 'Clicking your name or profile photo anywhere you see it takes you to your profile page. This shows you all the posts you have made in diaspora*. It also displays your profile photo, screen name, “about me” tags and your diaspora* ID (discussed under “Registration” in %{part1_link}).'
      profile_ex2: 'Under your profile photo you’ll see any private profile information you have added, such as birthday, location, gender, biography and so on.'
      profile_ex3: 'Click the blue <span class="click">Edit my profile</span> button if you want to change any of your profile information.'
      profile_ex4: 'You can also view someone else’s profile page by clicking their name or picture. How much of a person’s profile information and posts are made available to you depends on your connection with them. At the top right you’ll find an aspects button: grey if the person is not in one of your aspects; green if they are. Click it to add them to an aspect.'
      profile_ex5: 'Underneath their profile photo you’ll see an icon bar: grey (with a circle) if they’re not sharing with you, green (with a ✓) if they are. If you are ignoring that person, the bar will be red. It will contain the following icons, if they’re available to you: a @mention icon if you are sharing with that person, and a message icon if you have mutual sharing.'
      profile_ex6: 'Also in the left-hand column is a link to the person’s uploaded photos, and any of their contacts which they have made visible to you (which is explained in the next part, “Aspects”).'
      finish: 'That’s all you need to know about the interface for now. The first thing you will want to do is finding some people to start sharing with. However, before we get to that, let’s focus on something that features prominently throughout diaspora*: aspects.'
    getting_started3:
      byline: 'Part 3 – Aspects'
      menu_title: 'All about aspects'
      aspects1: 'Think of your life and the people you know. Each person is a part of one or more aspects of your life. They might be a member of your family, a close friend, a work colleague or someone you play sport or music with or with whom you share a particular interest. Or they might be part of more than one of these aspects of your life.'
      aspects2: 'diaspora* works in exactly the same way. You can place contacts into an “aspect” of your diaspora* seed based on which aspect of your life they are part of. In this way, you control which of your contacts sees each post you make to diaspora*, by posting to a particular aspect or aspects. We’ll explain more about what this means over the next three parts of this series.'
      aspects3: 'When you sign up you are given four aspects: Family, Work, Friends and Acquaintances. Of course you will not be able to sort all of your life into just four standard aspects, so the first thing we’re going to do is to add some aspects. You can also delete the default aspects if you want to.'
      aspects4: 'Click <span class="click">My Aspects</span> in the left-hand column and your list of aspects will appear. To add an aspect, click <span class="click"><em>+ Add an aspect</em></span> under the list of aspects in the left-hand column. You will be presented with a pop-up window.'
      add_aspect1: 'Choose a name for the new aspect. This might reflect the common connection between these people, perhaps “Creative writing,” “Football,” or “Activists;” but you can call it whatever you like. No one else will ever be able to see the names of your aspects, nor will your contacts know which aspect they are in. For this exercise, I suggest creating an aspect called “Diaspora,” into which you can place people you meet here.'
      add_aspect2: 'Decide whether to check “Make contacts in this aspect visible to each other?” This is useful if this aspect is for a club in which all the members know each other, as making them visible to each other will help them to connect with each other. However, you should use this with care, and consider other people’s privacy before doing so.'
      add_aspect3: 'When you have finished, click the <span class="click">Create</span> button. The aspect is then created and selected in the menu.'
      add_aspect4: 'Once the aspect has been created, you’ll be taken to a list of contacts in that aspect (which will be no one so far). There’s a link to “add contacts to Diaspora” (or whatever you have called your new aspect).'
      my_aspects1: 'Next, let’s look at the My Aspects menu in the left-hand column. Get back to your stream and click <span class="click">My Aspects</span>. Your list of aspects will drop down, and you’ll see a stream containing only posts made by people you have placed into whichever aspects are selected in the list.'
      my_aspects2: 'Right now all your aspects should be selected, with ticks next to them.'
      my_aspects3: 'You can click aspects in the menu to select or deselect them.'
      my_aspects4: 'You can select just one aspect, or any combination of them.'
      my_aspects5: 'If all aspects are selected and you want to view just one, click <span class="click">Deselect all</span> and then select the one you want.'
      my_aspects6: 'Why not play around with it for a few seconds?'
      my_aspects7: 'This selection system has two uses:'
      my_aspects8: 'It filters the content stream. You might want to read only posts written by people in your Family aspect. Or you might want to read everything posted by your contacts <em>except</em> family members.'
      my_aspects9: 'If you post a status message from the Aspects page, the aspects selected in the left-hand menu will be automatically selected in the publisher. For example, if the Friends, Family and Work aspects are selected in the list, when you click in the publisher window you’ll see that the Aspects selector button reads “In 3 aspects.”'
      contacts: 'Contacts page'
      contact_ex1: 'We mentioned your contacts page in %{part2_link}. To get to your contacts page, click the arrow at the right-hand end of the header bar and select <span class="click">Contacts</span> from the drop-down list.'
      contact_ex3: 'The contacts page shows your aspects in the left-hand column, and your contacts in those aspects displayed on the right-hand side.'
      contact_ex4: 'If you are displaying contacts from all aspects (click <span class="click">My Contacts</span> in the left-hand column), each contact will have a green button to its right show which aspect(s) they have been placed in. If a contact is in more than one aspect, the button will read “In <em>n</em> aspects.” Click the button to see which aspects those are.'
      contact_ex5: 'You can click this button to change the aspect(s) this person is in by selecting and deselecting aspects in the drop-down list. If you want to remove a person from all of your aspects, deselect all aspects and the button will turn grey. You are no longer sharing with them.'
      contact_ex6: 'If you are viewing contacts in an individual aspect, there will be a cross to the right of each contact displayed. Clicking this will remove the person from that aspect.'
      contact_ex7: 'You can also create new aspects from your contacts page.'
      sharing_me: 'Only sharing with me'
      sharing_me_ex: 'This shows you a list of people who are sharing with you but with whom you are not sharing – your “followers.”'
      finish: 'Now that you understand aspects, let’s make some connections.'
    getting_started4:
      byline: 'Part 4 – Finding and connecting with people'
      menu_title: 'How to connect with people'
      aspects1: 'It’s now time to add some contacts to the “Diaspora” aspect you just created. If you already know people who are using diaspora*, you can find them and add them to any aspect you like.'
      sharing: 'Sharing'
      sharing_ex: 'We call connecting with someone “sharing” because it’s an indication that you want to share content with them. Sharing in diaspora* can seem a bit confusing at first, because your levels of sharing with other people are unlikely to be the same as their levels of sharing with you. Let’s try to make sense of what that means.'
      relationships: 'On diaspora* there are three types of relations between users:'
      followers: 'Followers'
      followers_ex1: 'Someone has placed you into one of their aspects, but you haven’t done likewise for them. You will get a notification that this person has “started sharing with you” but you won’t notice any other change.'
      followers_ex2:  'They will see your public posts in their stream, but none of your limited posts.'
      followers_ex3: 'There’s no way to tell which aspect someone else has placed you in, for privacy reasons – it’s their business which of their aspects they place each person in, so no one else can find out.'
      following: 'Following'
      following_ex1: 'You are sharing with a person who is not sharing with you. This means that you have added them to one (or more) of your aspects, but they have not added you to their aspects.'
      following_ex2: 'The person you are following will have access to posts you have made to the aspect(s) you have placed them in as well as your public posts, and you will start receiving their public posts in your stream.'
      mutual: 'Mutual sharing'
      mutual_ex1: 'If two of you have started sharing with each other, things get more interesting, and more complicated! This can be compared to being “friends” on Facebook, although there are important differences.'
      mutual_ex2: 'When there’s a mutual connection, the two of you have each indicated a desire to see posts from the other, so each of you will see limited posts made by the other person to the aspect(s) into which the other has placed you. However, your sharing with each other might be very different. Think of the following scenario:'
      mutual_ls1: 'You consider Jill a slight acquaintance, and put her in your “Acquaintances” aspect.'
      mutual_ls2: 'Jill, however, thinks of you one of her best friends, and puts you in her “Close friends” aspect.'
      mutual_ls3: 'You post most things only to your “Friends” or “Family” aspects, so Jill doesn’t see many of your posts.'
      mutual_ls4: 'Because you’re in Jill’s “Close friends” aspect, on the other hand, you see almost everything she posts.'
      mutual_ex3: 'The main thing to remember is that <span class="click">no one</span> will ever see a post unless you have made it public or have made it to an aspect into which you have manually placed that person.'
      finding: 'Finding people'
      finding_ex1: 'In order to start sharing with people, you will have to start following some people. Perhaps they will follow you back! Let’s look at how to do that now.'
      finding_ex2: 'There are several ways to find someone and add them to an aspect.'
      search: 'Search'
      search_ex: 'The search field is in the header bar. To add someone by search:'
      search_ls1: 'Type a name or diaspora* ID. Suggestions will appear as you start typing.'
      search_ls2: 'Hit enter to search, and you will land on a page with results.'
      search_ls3: 'When you have found the person you are looking for, click the <span class="click">Add Contact</span> button.'
      search_ls4: 'If the person you want to start sharing with appears in the list of suggestions, just select their name to get to their profile page and click the <span class="click">Add Contact</span> button from there.'
      search_ls5: 'A drop-down menu will then appear under the button in which you can select which aspect(s) to add the person to. You can also create a new aspect and add them to that aspect by clicking <span class="click"><em>+ Add an aspect</em></span>.'
      search_ls6: 'Once you select one or more aspects, the aspect button will turn green and you will instantly start sharing posts to those aspects with the person while at the same time you will start following their public posts.'
      invite: 'Sending an invitation mail'
      invite_ex: 'Another way to follow a friend is by sending them an invitation mail. This can be done through the <span class="click">by mail </span> link in the menu on the right of the search results page or from the <span class="click">Invite your friends</span> link in the sidebar of the stream page. As soon as your friend accepts the invite, they will be taken through the same registration process you have just been through.'
      profile: 'From their profile'
      profile_ex1: 'Another way to add a person to one of your aspects is by clicking their name wherever you see it in diaspora*. This will take you to their profile page, from where you will be able to add them to aspects using the button in the top right corner of the page.'
      profile_ex2: 'Alternatively, just hover over their name or profile photo in the stream, and a small “hover-card” will appear. You can add them to an aspect directly from this hover-card.'
      tags: 'Following #tags'
      tags_ex: 'The above three options focus on connecting to people you already know. But sometimes strangers can be just as interesting, if not more interesting, than people you already know. A great way to start connecting with people is to start following some #tags of subjects that interest you. Posts containing those tags will then appear in your stream, and you can follow people who post things which you find interesting, by placing them into one of your aspects.'
      removing: 'Removing someone from your contacts'
      removing_ex1: 'To remove someone from your contacts completely and thereby stop sharing with them, all you need to do is to remove them from all aspects you have placed them in. You can do this by:'
      removing_ex2: 'either going to their profile page or hovering your cursor over their name in the stream and waiting for a hovercard to appear;'
      removing_ex3: 'clicking the arrow on the green aspect selector button and deselect all the aspects ticked.'
      removing_ex4: 'That’s it! Once they are no longer in any of your aspects, you are no longer sharing with that person.'
      removing_ex5: 'You can also remove a person from your aspects via your contacts page, which we covered at the end of %{part3_link}.'
      finish: 'You now know how to start sharing with people, and hopefully you’ve been able to add some contacts. You’ll now start seeing content from them in your stream; and once people have started sharing with you, you’ll have an audience for your posts. <strong>It’s time to start publishing some content.</strong>'
    getting_started5:
      byline: 'Part 5 – Start sharing!'
      menu_title: 'Start sharing!'
      intro1: 'Now that you have some contacts, it’s time to start sharing content with them.'
      intro2: 'You can communicate via diaspora* either by sharing a status message with a group of followers, or even to the whole of diaspora*; or by sending a private message to one or more mutual contacts. In this part we will focus on using the publisher and content stream to post and comment on status messages. We’ll look at sending a private message (which we call a “conversation”) in %{part6_link}.'
      publisher: 'The publisher'
      publisher_ex1: 'Sharing content in diaspora* is done via the publisher, which is located at the top of the middle column on most pages in the diaspora* interface. You have probably already clicked it, and if you did you probably weren’t able to resist posting something! Posting a status message is as simple as can be. A bit later in this tutorial we’ll look at some of the more complex things you can do with the publisher, but let’s start with an introduction.'
      publisher_ex2: 'The publisher may look like a dull, narrow box but don’t let its appearance deceive you: beneath its minimalist appearance lies a treasure trove of features, which you can trigger by clicking inside the box.'
      publisher_ex3: 'Once the publisher box has “come alive,” you’ll see a range of buttons and icons. Before we look at them in detail, let’s ignore them and post a simple status message available only to your followers and mutual contacts.'
      publisher_ex4: 'To do this, all you need to do is to type your message – whatever you want to say to them, perhaps “This is my first post in Diaspora” – and press the <span class="click">Share</span> button. And you’ve shared a message with your contacts!'
      buttons: 'OK, so what are those buttons all about?'
      aspect_selector: 'Aspect selector button'
      aspect_selector_ex1: 'This button is how you select who will be able to read your post. It is set to “All Aspects” by default: that is, everyone you have added to one of your aspects will be able to read the message, but no one else will be. In the simple message you just sent, because you wanted it visible just to your followers and the default is “All aspects,” there was no need to change any settings before sharing your message.'
      aspect_selector_ex2: 'With this button you can select any individual aspect to share with, or any combination of your aspects, by clicking on aspects in the list to select or unselect them. In this way you have complete control over who gets to read your messages, as we discussed in %{part3_link}. If, on the other hand, you want to announce something to the whole world, select “Public,” and there will be no restrictions on who can read your message.'
      photo: 'Photo sharing'
      photo_ex: 'At the right-hand end of the text field is a camera icon that lets you upload photos to your message. You can either click on it and select some pictures from your computer, or drag the images straight from a folder to the button.'
      locator: 'Locator'
      locator_ex1: 'Next to the camera is a “pin” icon which activates the locator feature. This enables you to add your location to posts. Click it and it will ask you whether you’re happy for it to determine your location using OpenStreetMaps, and if you allow this it will add your location to your post as a footnote.'
      locator_ex2: 'You can edit this location by clicking on the text once it appears under the publisher window.'
      locator_ex3: 'The location provided may be very exact, so you might want to edit out the specific address information and just give the town or region you’re in. It’s up to you!'
      connected: 'Connected services'
      connected_ex1: 'Based on the connections you have made with your accounts on other social networks (Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr), there may be icons for these services under the publisher. Highlighting these posts your message to those services. We’ll cover this in the next section, below.'
      connected_ex2: 'The icon next to your connected services looks like a spanner. Clicking this will let you configure your connections with other social networks and services.'
      connected_ex3: 'We’ll look at how to connect to other services in %{part7_link}.'
      preview: 'Post preview'
      preview_ex1: 'Between the aspects and share buttons is the last button – and a really useful one! This allows you to see what your post will look like, so you can be sure you’re happy with it before you actually post it. This can really help with correcting errors, and especially with text formatting. More on this below.'
      preview_ex2: 'That is all there is to know about the buttons and icons on the publisher. The real magic happens within the publisher itself. As well as plain text, you can add #tags, @mentions, links, format your text and embed photos, videos and audio. Wow!'
      features: 'Posting features'
      tags: '#tags'
      tags_ex1: 'Place a # (hash) symbol in front of a word and it becomes a #tag. What’s the use of this? Well, #tags are a great way of finding content that interests you, and of bringing content to the attention of people who are likely to be interested in it. You can search for tags by typing them in the search field in the header. You can also follow tags, so that any posts containing those tags appear in your stream – in fact, if you filled out the “Describe yourself in 5 words” part of your profile page, you’re already following those tags!'
      tags_ex2: 'Say you like cooking and you post a message with “#cooking” in it. Anyone who follows the #cooking tag will now see your post appear in their streams. Of course for any follower of #cooking to see your post, you’ll have had to make it a public post; if you made it only to one or more aspects, only people in those aspects will be able to read it. You can also search for “#cooking” in the search bar, and you’ll be presented with a list of all posts tagged with “#cooking.” That includes your own posts, posts by friends and public posts by other diasporans. You can see how this can be a fantastic tool for finding and sharing content with people who share your interests.'
      tags_ex3: 'If your post might potentially cause offence or get someone into trouble for viewing it at work, please add the <span class="click">#nsfw</span> (“not safe for work”) tag so that it will be hidden on people’s screens unless they choose to view it. We’ll cover this in %{part7_link}.'
      mentions: '@mentions'
      mentions_ex1: 'Did you know you can grab someone’s attention by “mentioning” them? Simply type a @ symbol followed by the name of one of your contacts. As you start typing their name (their screen name, not their user name) it will automatically be completed by diaspora*. Hit enter or click the name in the auto-completer and you’ll notice that it has changed to their full name, and the @ symbol has disappeared. Don’t worry, though; this will become an @mention once you have posted the message. The person you are mentioning will receive a notification of the mention on their notification page, and by email if they have asked to receive email notification of mentions.'
      mentions_ex2: 'Likewise other people can @mention you, and you’ll receive a notification in the header bar (and by email if you have set that option).'
      mentions_ex3: 'Note that you can only @mention people people in your aspects; and only in posts, not in comments.'
      format: 'Text formatting'
      format_ex: 'There’s a lot you can do to make your text more varied: bold, italics, large headings and so on. diaspora* uses a simple mark-up system called Markdown. It’s not in the scope of this introduction, however, so we explore how to use Markdown in %{format_link}.'
      format_link_text: 'this tutorial'
      links: 'Links'
      links_ex: 'Want to include a link in your post? Just paste it into your message and it will automatically be converted to an inline link. You can also contain your link within your text by using Markdown. You can use the <span class="click">Preview</span> button to check that your links are working properly before you post your message.'
      embed: 'Embedding'
      embed_ex1: 'You can also paste links to media sites such as YouTube, Vimeo, Soundcloud and others, and the video/audio file you’re linking to will become “embedded” in your post. Try it!'
      embed_ex2: 'Note that the video/audio will only become embedded <em>after</em> you have posted your message, so you’ll have to refresh/reload the stream in order to see it. Occasionally it takes a while for the site which hosts the file you want to embed to respond with the embed information, so you might have to wait a short while and refresh the stream again.'
      services: 'Posting to other services'
      services_ex1: 'If you have conntected your diaspora* seed to your accounts on other services, clicking on one or more of the icons for those services below the publisher means your message will appear on those networks as well.'
      services_ex2: 'When you start writing a message with one of more of these icons highlighted, a character counter will show how many more characters are available to you: 140 for Twitter, 1000 for Tumblr, 63,206 for Facebook. In diaspora*, you can post a whopping 65,535 characters! The counter will always display the number of characters remaining for the service selected which allows the fewest characters; so, if you highlight the Twitter and Facebook logos, it will count down from 140 characters.'
      services_ex3: 'If your message is longer than the figure allowed by the service you’re posting to, your message will appear truncated on that service, with a link to your post in diaspora*.'
      how: 'How about that? There’s plenty of things you can do in your posts in diaspora*.'
      try_out: 'To try it out, why not make a public announcement that you’ve just arrived in diaspora*? This is a good way to get welcomed by people in our community, and to start to make connections.'
      make_post1: 'To make a public post, just set the aspect selector button to <span class="click">Public</span>, and type your post. If you didn’t do it earlier, why not introduce yourself to the diaspora* community by including the <span class="click">#newhere</span> tag? This way, people who follow that tag will see your post and be able to welcome you. Include some of your interests as #tags as well, and you’ll find that people with similar interests to you will find you. Your message might be something like:'
      make_post2: 'Hi everyone, I’m #newhere in diaspora*. I like #running, #literature and #rabbits.'
      make_post3: 'Of course, you might not want to make a public post. If not, that’s fine: the important thing is that you know how to do it.'
      interact: 'Interacting with posts in the stream'
      interact_ex1: 'The content stream is a real-time display of status messages. Whenever someone you follow posts a status message, it gets added to the stream. Naturally you can comment on your own posts and those made by other people. You can also “like” and “reshare” other people’s messages and, if someone posts something you really don’t want to see, you can hide it. All of this happens in the content stream, which can be found just below the publisher.'
      interact_ex2: 'Don’t forget that there are different content streams depending on which of the “views” you are using: <span class="click">Stream</span>, <span class="click">My Activity</span>, <span class="click">@Mentions</span>, <span class="click">My Aspects</span> or <span class="click">#Followed Tags</span>. While this alters which posts appear in your stream, you can interact with those posts in the same way in any of these views.'
      comments: 'Comments'
      comments_ex: 'If there are no comments on a post yet, click <span class="click">Comment</span> to open a comment field. When there are already comments below the post, the comment field will automatically be there. If more than three comments have been added, the last three comments will be shown. You can expand the full thread by clicking '
      likes: 'Likes'
      likes_ex1: 'Next to the <span class="click">Comment</span> link you will find a <span class="click">Like</span> link. This can be used to give the owner of the post a sign that you have read and appreciated their post, without having to actually comment. When you click the link, you will be added to a counter of the number of likes. Clicking this counter will show you those people who have liked the post.'
      likes_ex2: 'If you change your mind, you can remove your “like” by clicking the <span class="click">Unlike</span> link which is now visible. But be aware that the person whose post you originally liked has already been sent a notification!'
      reshare: 'Reshare posts'
      reshare_ex: 'Public posts made by other people can be reshared. In order to reshare a post, click the <span class="click">Reshare</span> link, which can be found between the Like and Comment links. Resharing a post makes it visible to your followers, and can help spread a good message to a new audience.'
      delete: 'Deleting posts and comments'
      delete_ex: 'When you hover your mouse pointer over one of your own posts or one of the comments, an <span class="click">x</span> will appear in the top right corner, which allows you to delete the post or comment. You can also delete your own comments on other people’s posts.'
      hide: 'Hiding someone’s post'
      hide_ex: 'If you don’t want to see someone else’s post again, you can hide it from your stream by clicking the <span class="click">x</span>, just as you would to delete your own post.'
      ignore: 'Ignore a user'
      ignore_ex1: 'If you find that a person’s posts are annoying, boring or offending you, you can ignore that person. This means that their posts will no longer appear in your stream; however, they will still be able to comment on, like or reshare your posts, and their comments on your and other people’s posts which appear in your stream will be visible to you. To ignore someone, hover over one of their posts and click the icon next to the little “x” in the top right corner – it looks like a person with a line through. When you ignore someone, their posts don’t immediately disappear; you’ll have to refresh the screen.'
      ignore_ex2: 'A list of people you are ignoring can be found in your account settings under <span class="click">Privacy</span>. If you want to stop ignoring someone, you can remove them from that page. We cover how to get to your account settings page in '

      byline: 'Part 6 – Notifications and conversations'
      menu_title: 'Notifications and conversations'
      intro: 'The last big feature you should definitely know about is “conversations.” Before we do that, however, let’s mention notifications.'
      notify: 'Notifications'
      notify_ex1: 'Clicking the notifications icon (which looks like a satellite) in the header bar brings down a drop-down list showing the five most recent notifications. If you have unread notifications, this will appear as a number in red over the icon.'
      notify_ex2: 'Notifications tend to take the form “Person A has commented on Person B’s post,” “Person A started sharing with you,” or “Person A has mentioned you in a post.” From this drop-down, you can:'
      notify_ls1: 'Click the person’s name to view their profile page.'
      notify_ls2: 'Click <span class="click">post</span> to view that post.'
      notify_ls3: 'Click <span class="click">Mark all as read</span>.'
      notify_ls4: 'Click <span class="click">View all</span> to go to the Notifications page.'
      notify_ex3: 'The notifications page shows you all previous notifications made to you, 25 to a page.'
      convo: 'Conversations'
      convo_ex1: 'A conversation is a private communication between two or more people. To access this feature, click the envelope icon in the header bar.'
      convo_ex2: 'The conversations page consists of two columns: on the left, a list of conversations you have been involved in; on the right, a view of the currently selected conversation (if any).'
      convo_ex3: 'Use the <span class="click">New Message</span> button at the top of the left-hand column to start a new conversation. The button will open a pop-up window in which you can write a message and add people to include in the conversation.'
      convo_ex4: 'You can only start conversations with people with whom you have mutual sharing.'
      convo_ex5: 'When typing a name into the “to” line, the name will be auto-completed, just like when you mention someone. Click the name of the person you want to contact, add a subject in the subject line, type your message and off you go! It is that simple. You can also use text formatting here, so feel free to add bold titles and big headers in your message.'
      convo_ex6: 'In the left-hand column, you’ll see a list of conversations, with the title, profile picture of the person who started the conversation, the name of the last person to have replied to it, and to the right the number of contributions to the conversation (in grey; if there are unread messages this will be indicated in red), the time since the last contribution, and underneath, a “multiple persons” icon if there is more than one person other than you involved. Move your cursor over this icon to see who else is involved.'
      convo_ex7: 'You can read a conversation by clicking it in the left-hand column, after which it will open on the right. At the top left you will find a list of recipients (including people who haven’t yet contributed to the conversation). Make sure to check this before starting to gossip! There may well be more people included in the conversation, all of whom will see your reply.'
      convo_ex8: 'Replying to a conversation is pretty straightforward. Once it’s displayed on your screen, simply type your reply into the publisher window at the bottom of the conversation, and press the <span class="click">Reply</span> button.'
      convo_ex9: 'It is possible to delete a conversation from your item list. This can be done by selecting the conversation in the left-hand menu and then clicking the <span class="click">x</span> in the top right corner. Blocking a conversation means you will delete it from the list of conversations and stop receiving any new replies. Please not that it is still possible for others to send replies to other participants in the conversation – you will just not receive them any more.'
      finish: 'That is all there is to be said about conversations. You have almost got through the tutorial! It’s time to read the last part!'

      menu_title: 'Finishing up'
      intro: 'We have now covered most of the main features on diaspora*. The last part of this tutorial series deals with the last few bits and pieces you’ll need to know about.'
      connect: 'Connecting your diaspora* seed to other services'
      connect_ex1: 'You can connect your diaspora* seed to several other services: Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. Of course, to do this, you’ll have to have an account on that service!'
      connect_ex2: 'Before starting this, make sure you have your account information for that service to hand, because you may need to authorise your connection with that other service in order for it to work.'
      connect_ex3: 'To connect to another service, click the icon for that service under <span class="click">Connect Services</span> in the right-hand column of the stream. If you’re already logged in to your account on that service in the same browser, it should recognise you automatically. If you’re not currently logged in to that service, it’ll ask you to log in now. Once you’re logged in, it will ask for authorisation to publish to your account in that service. Accept this, and you’re ready to post directly from your diaspora* seed to that service!'
      connect_ex4: 'When you next click in the publisher, you’ll see the icon for that service under the publisher. Click this icon to activate it, and your post will also appear in your stream on that service. Pretty nifty, eh? See %{part5_link} for more information on posting to connected services.'
      settings: 'Account management'
      settings_ex1: 'The final thing we need to look at to get you started is the user settings page. To reach it, click on your picture or name in the header bar and, from the drop-down menu, choose <span class="click">Settings</span>. Here you will find an overview of account options.'
      settings_ex3: 'At the top of the account settings page are four links: Profile, Account, Privacy and Services.'
      profile: 'Profile'
      profile_ex: 'On this page you can change, add to or delete any of your profile information. Go back to the end of %{part1_link} if you want a reminder of how to edit it. Don’t forget to press the <span class="click">Update</span> button at the bottom once you’re finished!'
      account: 'Account'
      account_ex1: 'Here you can change your email address and password, set your language, pick your email notification preferences and download your data or close your seed. Our aim is that you’ll be able to use the downloaded data to migrate your seed to another pod, although this is not yet possible. You might wish to download your data periodically as a back-up, however.'
      account_ex2: 'diaspora* has a self-governing community standard called NSFW (not safe for work). If you’re likely to post much material which may not be suitable for everyone to view at their office desk (perhaps with their boss standing behind them), please consider checking the NSFW box. This will hide your posts from people’s streams behind a notice that the post is marked as NSFW. They can then click this notice to view your post if they wish.'
      account_ex3: 'By leaving this box unchecked, you are committing yourself not to post any material which could potentially cause offence or get someone into trouble for viewing it at work. If, on the other hand, you might want to post such material only occasionally, you could leave this box unchecked and add the <span class="click">#nsfw</span> tag to those individual posts, which will hide them from other people’s streams.'
      account_ex4: 'If you want, you can set your seed to automatically start sharing with anyone who starts sharing with you, so that you’ll be mutual contacts.'
      privacy: 'Privacy'
      privacy_ex: 'This is a list of users you are ignoring. You can remove them from this list if you want to start seeing posts from them again. See %{part5_link} for more on ignoring people.'
      services: 'Services'
      services_ex: 'The Services page shows your connected services (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr) and allows you to connect new services to your diaspora* seed.'

    formatting:
      byline: 'Formatting text'
      menu_title: 'Formatting text'
      format1: 'On diaspora* it’s possible to format your text in status messages, comments and conversations using a simplified mark-up system called Markdown. This page gives an introduction to the codes used to create this formatting.'
      format2: 'The first thing to note is that you must use two line breaks between paragraphs (except items in a list), otherwise the paragraps will run together. If you really want just one line break between two paragraphs, add two spaces at the end of the first paragraph.'
      format3: 'This is where the <span class="click">Preview</span> button comes in really handy. Try some formatting, preview it, work out what isn’t right, fix it, and preview again, until you’re happy!'
      format4: 'In the examples below, you can copy the text in the grey areas and paste it into the publisher in diaspora* and use the <span class="click">Preview</span> button to try out some formatting.'
      headings: 'Headings'
      headings_ex1: 'You can add first-, second- and third-level headings to your message by placing a hash symbol (#) at the start of a line, as follows:'
      headings_code1: 'This is an extremely large header'
      headings_code2: 'Half as big as the one above'
      headings_code3: 'Twice the size of normal text'
      headings_ex2: 'Make sure to leave a space between the hashes and your text, to avoid creating a #tag instead of a heading. The heading ends once you hit enter to proceed to the next line.'
      lists: 'Lists'
      lists_ex1: 'To create an bulleted list, place either *, + or - in front of each line you want as part of the list.'
      lists_ex2: 'It’s also possible to make numbered lists by placing “1.”, “2.”, etc. in front of the list items. To create a numbered list, the numbers must have periods/full stops after them.'
      lists_ex3: 'Again, make sure to leave a space between the “bullet” character and the text on each line, and to leave a line space between the list and any preceding/following text, otherwise it will not work.'
      lists_code1: 'This is how to create a bulleted list:'
      lists_code2: 'item one;'
      lists_code3: 'item two;'
      lists_code4: 'item three.'
      lists_code5: 'This will become another bulleted list:'
      lists_code6: 'And this will be a numbered list:'
      code: 'Code blocks'
      code_ex1: 'If you are a developer you may be interested in code blocks. To create a code block, start your text/code with four backticks ( ` ` ` ` ). To return to normal text, close the code block with another four.'
      code_ex2: 'Another way to do this is to start each of your lines of code with four spaces. Adding more spaces will allow for further indenting.'
      code_ex3: 'It’s also possible to display code inline, `<code>by starting and ending the snippet with a backtick</code>`.'
      code_code1: 'This is a line of normal text.'
      code_code2: 'this will be a code block'
      code_code3: 'Then some more more normal text.'
      code_code4: 'and then a bit more code'
      code_code5: 'a line of code indented by two spaces'
      line: 'Horizontal line'
      line_ex: 'To create a horizontal line, use at least three - - -, _ _ _ or * * * on a separate line. Any number above three will do the same thing and spaces between the characters do not matter.'
      line_code1: 'There will be a horizontal rule between this line of text and the next one.'
      line_code2: 'And now you can start the next section of your text.'
      itals: 'Italics and bold'
      itals_ex1: 'Place either asterisks or underscores either side of a word or words to make them italic, bold or bold italic.'
      itals_ex2: '<em>Italics</em>: *word* or _word_'
      itals_ex3: '<strong>Bold</strong>: **word** or __word__'
      itals_ex4: '<strong><em>Bold italics</em></strong>: ***word*** or ___word___'
      itals_ex8: 'You must of course match the asterisks/underscores in pairs either side of words for the formatting to work. Typing “I want to display this as a **bold* word” won’t display the word in bold.'
      links: 'Inline links'
      link_ex1: 'To create an %{inline_link}, use the following code:'
      link_code: '[displayed text here](http://link.address.here "alt text")'
      link_ex2: 'The “alt text” is optional, and is displayed as a tool-tip when the cursor is moved over the link.'
      inline_link_text: 'inline link'
      images: 'Images'
      images_ex1: 'To add external images to your post, comment or private message, use the same code as for a link, but with an exclamation point at the front:'
      images_code: '![Alt text](http://website.com/image.jpg "optional title")'
      images_ex2: 'For this to work, you must provide a direct link to a valid image file, <em>not</em> to a web page with an image or images on it.'
      images_ex3: 'The alternative text in the square brackets is displayed if the image cannot be loaded, and the optional title is displayed as a tool-tip when the cursor is moved over the image; both are useful but not essential.'
      escape_ex1: 'If you want your message to include a character which is also used in Markdown coding, you can prevent it from being read by Markdown as a formatting code by “escaping” it. To do this, place a backslash ( \ ) in front of the character. For example, typing'
      escape_code: 'this \_ is an underscore'
      escape_ex2: 'prevents Markdown from reading the underscore as a Markdown code and allows diaspora* to display the underscore rather than creating italic text.'
      escape_ex3: 'You can, however, type “diaspora*” or “D*” without the asterisk becoming a formatting code!'

      profile: 'Extra profile fields'
      profile_ex: 'A simple way to make your profile more appealing is by adding more “profile fields” using text formatting in the Bio section. Use **bold** to create titles, and optionally use *italic* for the items. This way you can add any profile field you can possibly think of, such as music, books, relationship, and so on.'
      notepad: 'Use diaspora* as a notebook'
      notepad_ex: 'You can even use diaspora* as a notebook, to jot down things you’ll need to remember later, perhaps even notes for a presentation you’re giving. To do this, all you need to do is to create an aspect and <strong>add no one to it</strong>! That’s right, an empty aspect. What’s the point of this? Well, it means you can share things with this aspect, and no one will be able to see them. That means that this aspect can act as your private notebook. It can be a useful way of moving text or photos between one computer and another, and of keeping your notes and photos safe for whenever you log in to diaspora*.'
